We show a mobile robot social navigation system combining trajectory prediction with reinforcement learning and Large Language Model (LLM) reward tuning. Using Spatial Occupancy Grid Maps (SOGMs) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), our approach, enhanced by Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Eureka, shows improved adaptability in dynamic environments
