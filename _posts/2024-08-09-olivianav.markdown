We introduce OLiVia-Nav, an online lifelong vision language architecture for mobile robot social navigation. By leveraging large vision-language models (VLMs) and a novel distillation process called SC-CLIP, OLiVia-Nav efficiently encodes social and environmental contexts, adapting to dynamic human environments.
