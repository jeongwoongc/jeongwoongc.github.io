We present Finder, a novel approach to the multi-object search problem that leverages vision language models (VLMs) to efficiently locate multiple objects in diverse unknown environments. Our method combines semantic mapping with spatio-probabilistic reasoning and adaptive planning, improving object recognition and scene understanding through VLMs.
