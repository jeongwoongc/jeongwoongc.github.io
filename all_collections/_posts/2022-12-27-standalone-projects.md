#### [Smart MIDI File Randomizer](https://nbviewer.org/github/jeongwoongc/jeongwoongc.github.io/blob/main/all_collections/JupyterNBs/Standalone_MIDI/MIDI.ipynb)

This project stems from my hobby of making music. The final product will be able to randomize a MIDI file into different patterns that sound good. The "Smart" part is that it wont just randomize the pattern for the sake of randomizing it. This will be used to draw different melody inspirations within the same pitch of notes.

#### [Siegebot]() (In Progress)

The idea stems from the game "Rainbow Six Siege" and the drone in the game which will have autonomous abilities with remote controlled capabilities. The drone will also be able to detect and avoid obstacles. The drone will be able to be controlled remotely with a controller.
